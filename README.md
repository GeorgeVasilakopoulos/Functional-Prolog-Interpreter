# Functional Prolog Interpreter

Implementation of a Prolog interpreter, written in Haskell.\
The interpreter supports both 'Top-Down' and 'Bottom-Up' modes of operation.


This project was given as an assignment for the module `ΘΠ01 Principles of Programming Languages`, in the Fall Semester of 2023-2024\
The project's description (in Greek!) can be found under `docs/Project2023-2024.pdf`.\
This is the indicative implementation expected of students.
